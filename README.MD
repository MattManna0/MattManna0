Hello, my name is Matthew Manna and I have been an avid open source fanatic for some time now. 

My largest contribution has been redeveloping my school's online communications platform, as well as helping teachers with their build-tools. 

I am a member and operator of multiple open source and developer communities. 

I am always looking to engage in new open source projects and to support the ecosystem.
